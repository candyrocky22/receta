**UDON NOODLES**

These fat Japanese noodles are made from wheat flour and are served hot in soups and stir fries as well as cold with dipping sauce. They have a chewy, but tender, springy texture, which comes from repeated rolling and kneading. Udon is sold fresh and dried and both varieties need to be boiled.

How to Make Udon Noodles
Serves: 2

* 3 cups/300 g all-purpose flour
* 3 tbsp potato starch
* ⅔ cup/150 ml water
* ½ tbsp salt
* 1¼ tsp grapeseed oil

1. Combine all above ingredients in a bowl and mix well to form a dough.
2. On the counter, knead the dough for several minutes. Roll the dough out
   into a rectangular shape and fold the dough twice (like making puff
   pastry) and roll the dough out again. Repeat the “roll and fold” several
   times. The more you repeat the process, the springier the dough will
   be and the better consistency it will have.
3. Put the kneaded dough into a sealable plastic storage bag and seal it.
   Let the dough rest at room temperature for 24 hrs. **IT MUST BE ROOM
   TEMPERATURE.**
4. Dust the counter with flour and roll out the dough to a thickness
   from ⅛- to ¼-inch/3- to 5-mm. Fold the dough into half, sprinkling
   with enough flour first so that the two sides do not stick to each other.
   Cut the dough with a knife to size (about the width of linguine noodles).
5. Spread the noodles out so they do not stick to each other.
6. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles for 10 to 12 minutes.
   Drain and serve in prepared broth.
   _Time saving tip:_ You can make the dough ahead and cook the noodles,
   drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again. Then divide them into
   single servings and freeze the portions.
